# Instructions to configure csgo properly.
# In short, the idea is to have a single file (autoexec.cfg) containing all possible keybuttons, settings etc. 
# This file is then read each time csgo is launched.
# The effect is the same as if the lines in the file 'autoexec.cfg' were manually copy-pasted to the console window.
# Therefore, all changes should be done in the file 'autoexec.cfg'.
